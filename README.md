Go HTTP Router Benchmark
========================

This benchmark suite aims to compare the performance of HTTP request routers for [Go](https://golang.org) by implementing the routing structure of some real world APIs.
Some of the APIs are slightly adapted, since they can not be implemented 1:1 in some of the routers.

Of course the tested routers can be used for any kind of HTTP request â†’ handler function routing, not only (REST) APIs.

## Usage

This may take a while due to the large number of dependencies that need to be downloaded. Once that command has finished you can run the full set of benchmarks like this:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/julienschmidt/go-http-routing-benchmark
go test -bench=. > benchmark_results.txt
```
